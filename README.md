## Goal

1. Simulation of particulate flow based on the Boundary Integral Equation (BIE) method. 
2. Learn and follow the best practice of modern software engineering. 
3. Explore options for fast algorithms and parallelism in Python programming.

## Tasks

1. Learn the GitHub collaboration workflow: [How to Collaborate On GitHub](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267)
2. Learn basic Python programming (we switch from MATLAB to Python)
	* We use *Python 3* for our project
	* Know the difference: [Python vs Matlab](http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html)
	* Key things to learn: [NumPy, Scipy, and Matplotlib](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/)
	* Exercise: [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)
3. Code the Nystrom discretization of Laplace SLP and DLP
	* Collaborate this via GitHub
	* Write test cases: use the [unittest Package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
4. Comparison of FMM and Parallel Python
	* Survey the parallel programming options for python
		* [Multiprocessing package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)
	* Test the [Python FMM code](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfmmlib)
	* Design test cases for the comparison
